        <h1>My Top 3 Sites</h1>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Youtube</li>
                <p>I might have a problem because of how much I watch Youtube.<br> I mostly watch videos on video games (mostly Nintendo games) and fountain pens.<br> When I have nothing else to do, I am almost always watching Youtube videos.</p>
            <li>ESPN</li>
                <p>I keep up with a lot of sports. I am very invested basketball and <br>football, but I also watch quite a bit of baseball aswell.<br> My favorite teams are the Utah Jazz, Baltimore Ravens, and the Los Angeles Angels.</p>
            <li>Amazon</li>
                <p>Most of my time spent on Amazon is not purchasing stuff, it's browsing. <br> I find it fun to just browse for dumb stuff like "Unicorn Farts", which is just Cotton Candy.</p>
