        <h2>Theater</h2>
        <p>I am a big theater geek. Since I started going to Merit Academy I have been in every play/musical that they have done since I have been there. I have done a lot of villians in my time doing theater, most notably Jud Fry from Oklahoma! That role was awesome because I got to yell really loud on stage. One night I actually made a baby cry in the audience from yelling so loud.</p>
